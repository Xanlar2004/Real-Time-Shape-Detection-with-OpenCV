  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This project implements a real-time shape detection system in Python using OpenCV. It captures live video feed, identifies shapes like rectangles, triangles, and circles, and displays them       on the screen. Real-time shape recognition is highly useful in robotics, AR applications, and industries utilizing drones for object detection and interaction. Here are the features:<br>
     1. Real-time Detection: Detects and tracks shapes in live video.<br>
     2. Dynamic Parameters: Allows real-time adjustment of edge detection thresholds and contour area.<br>
     3. Image Stacking: Uses an image stacking function to arrange multiple frames for display.<br></p>
  
  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <p>Python Libraries:<br>
     Numpy: For numerical computation.<br>
     cv2 (OpenCV): For image processing and shape recognition.<br></p>

  <h2>Installation</h2>
  <p>Set Up Python Environment: Ensure Python is installed.<br>
      Install Packages: pip install numpy opencv-python<br>
      Run the Code: Open the code in VS Code or any preferred IDE. Execute shapedetection.py.<br></p>
